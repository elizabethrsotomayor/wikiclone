            <p class="info">Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee OM KBE FRS FREng FRSA DFBCS RDI (born 8 June 1955),[1] also known as TimBL, is an English
            computer scientist best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web, the HTML markup language, the URL system, and HTTP.
            He is a professorial research fellow at the University of Oxford[2] and a professor emeritus at the Massachusetts
            Institute of Technology (MIT).[3][4]
            
            Berners-Lee proposed an information management system on 12 March 1989[5][6] and implemented the first successful
            communication between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and server via the Internet in
            mid-November.[7][8][9][10][11] He devised and implemented the first Web browser and Web server and helped foster the
            Web's subsequent explosive development. He is the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which
            oversees the continued development of the Web. He co-founded (with Rosemary Leith) the World Wide Web Foundation. In
            April 2009, he was elected as Foreign Associate of the National Academy of Sciences.[12][13]
            
            Berners-Lee is a senior researcher and holder of the 3Com founder's chair at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial
            Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL).[14] He is a director of the Web Science Research Initiative (WSRI)[15] and a member of
            the advisory board of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence.[16][17] In 2011, he was named as a member of the board
            of trustees of the Ford Foundation.[18] He is a founder and president of the Open Data Institute and is currently an
            advisor at social network MeWe.[19] In 2004, Berners-Lee was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for his pioneering
            work.[20][21] He received the 2016 Turing Award "for inventing the World Wide Web, the first web browser, and the
            fundamental protocols and algorithms allowing the Web to scale".[22] He was named in Time magazine's list of the 100
            Most Important People of the 20th century and has received a number of other accolades for his invention.[23]</p>

            <p class="info">Timothy John Berners-Lee was born in London on 8 June 1955,[24] the son of mathematicians and computer scientists Mary
            Lee Woods (1924–2017) and Conway Berners-Lee (1921–2019). His parents were both from Birmingham and worked on the
            Ferranti Mark 1, the first commercially-built computer. His paternal grandmother was a Canadian woman from Winnipeg.[25]
            He has three younger siblings; his brother, Mike, is a professor of ecology and climate change management. Berners-Lee
            attended Sheen Mount Primary School, then attended the Emanuel School (a direct grant grammar school at the time) from
            1969 to 1973.[1][20] A keen trainspotter as a child, he learnt about electronics from tinkering with a model
            railway.[26] From 1973 to 1976, he studied at The Queen's College, Oxford, where he received a first-class BA in
            physics.[1][24] While there, he made a computer out of an old television set he had purchased from a repair shop.[27]</p>
